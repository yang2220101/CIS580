% Show the projections of P1 points in camera 2
% and the projections of P2 points in camera 1
%
% Since rows of P1 are expressed in camera frame 1
% (and rows of P2 in camera frame 2), you first need to 
% apply the 3D transformation (R,T) in the right direction,
% then apply K, then normalize by the third coordinate (this
% last step is taken care of in the call to 'plot' as you can
% see).
